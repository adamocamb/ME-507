# ME-507
A project from ME 507 at Cal Poly. We attempted a single-axis self-stabilizing gimbal, and were unable to completely finish the project by the end of the quarter. We did succesfully drive our motor and interface with our IMU. We had several hardware failures that led to delays and ran out of time to fully debug and troubleshoot our code.
