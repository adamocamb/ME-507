# ME-507
A project from ME 507 at Cal Poly in 2015. Our group attempted a single-axis self-stabilizing gimbal, and were unable to completely finish the project by the end of the quarter. We did succesfully drive our motor and interface with our IMU. We had several hardware failures that led to delays and ran out of time to fully debug and troubleshoot our code.

As part of this project we modified code from several sources on the web, as noted in comments in the relevant files.
